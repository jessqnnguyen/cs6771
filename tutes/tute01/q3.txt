=========================================================
Explain why if we change the first function prototype to:
void order3(int *const a, int *const b, int *const c)
The code still compiles and works as expected, but the following two function prototypes don't compile:
void order3(const int *a, const int *b, const int *c) - this is pointer to const int which can't be modified so it doesn't compile
since we can modify the pointer but we can't modify the int value
void order3(const unsigned int &a, const unsigned int &b, const unsigned int &c) -
same thing but with references, it's a reference to a const unsigned int/
Place the two order3 functions into a different cpp file from your main function.
Create a header file for the two order3 functions that you will include in the main cpp file.
Compile the code through a makefile that sperately compiles and links the various cpp and h files.
